The **Pizza World Sales Report** is a comprehensive data analysis project designed to provide actionable insights into sales performance. Leveraging the power of **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**, the initial analysis was conducted to calculate **key performance indicators (KPIs)** as outlined in the business problem statement. This foundational analysis ensured a robust understanding of the data, enabling precise and meaningful metrics.

The project then transitioned to **Power BI**, where an interactive and visually compelling dashboard was created. This dashboard not only presents the data in an accessible format but also highlights critical trends and outliers. The use of **DAX formulas** was integral to this phase, allowing for advanced calculations and dynamic data manipulation to meet the specific analytical requirements.

This project exemplifies proficiency in both **SQL** and **Power BI**, showcasing the ability to transform raw data into strategic business intelligence. The resulting dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to make informed decisions, driving business growth and efficiency.
